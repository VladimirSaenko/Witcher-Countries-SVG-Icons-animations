XiBeronne (UNICODE)
__________________________________________

... was created by Pia Frauss in 2005, with High-Logic's FontCreator program, updated and set to UNICODE in 2007, and updated again in 2010. You have downloaded the 2010 version (1.20). 

I hope you'll enjoy this font.

XiBeronne is free for private use. For commercial use, please visit my "Conditions of Use" page at

The lower case glyphs of XiBeronne are plain Black Letter. They were inspired by a celebrated French manuscript written at the beginning of the 15th century, containing  Gaston Phoebus' Book of the Hunt. The upper case characters are chiefly of my own invention, shaped to match a genuine *A* from another source.

As usual, you'll find a long *s* on the number sign. 

-- There is an ending *f* on the left bracket... 
-- ...and an ending *t* on the right bracket.
-- The left curly bracket contains a double *l*.
-- On the right curly bracket you'll find a little hook to be employed before the first letter of words beginning with *i*, *j*, *m*, *n*, *p*, *r*, *u*, *v*, *w*, and *z*. 
-- The bar sign contains an alternate *r*. 
-- Finally, on the ASCII tilde you'll find a contemporary abbreviaton sign of indefinite meaning, to be employed as a decoration wherever you see fit to place one. It's to be handled like an accent (the char won't move when you type it).

UPDATE 2007 has reduced the file size, by redesigning the composite glyphs, and corrected some minor flaws.

UPDATE 2010 has redesigned all of the composite glyphs (correcting the *dcaron*, *L/lcaron*, and *tcaron*), and enlarged the dashes.
